## Arithemetic Slices: 
Arithmetic Slices The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.  
Algorithm:  
1. Utilize a vector to store the difference between two nearby items.
2. If two numbers are the same, it means that it will increase 1+overlap(the accumulation for last item) slices.
